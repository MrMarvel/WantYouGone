There is profile and theme in /styles/ folder in repository. 
You need copy and paste carefully the content of the file in the JSON file.

After that you can find new pretty profile in terminal named 'Aperture'. Have fun!

If you wanna make your own lyrics you can exectue WYGgen.py, this will create a copy to lyrics.txt and set the delays for the lyrics you made, 

heres the syntax for a lyrics file :

- [/f] make the lyrics go faster
- [/s] make the lyrics go slower
- [/rs] same thing as /s but go even more slower
- [/ns] sets normal speed
- [/i] instant speed
- [/c] clears the screen
- [/nl] ***proper*** new line
- [/d] sets a delay before going to a new line, can be automated with WYGgen
## Examples

***/rs***im reallllyyy sloowww ***/ns***and im normal speed!
***/i***INSTANT!!! ***/nl***
